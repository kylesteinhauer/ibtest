## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ibtest.git
   cd ibtest
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install the package in development mode**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. **Install pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Write or update tests** for your changes

4. **Run the test suite** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

5. **Run code quality checks**:
   ```bash
   black src tests
   ruff check src tests
   mypy src
   ```

### Coding Standards

- **Code Style**: We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- **Linting**: We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting
- **Type Hints**: We use [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for high test coverage (>90%)
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

Example test:
```python
def test_hello_world_returns_correct_message():
    """Test that hello_world returns the expected greeting message."""
    result = hello_world()
    assert result == "Hello from IBTest!"
```

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any new features or API changes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Update the README.md if necessary

## Submitting Changes

   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - A clear, descriptive title
   - A detailed description of the changes
   - References to any related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

3. **Ensure all checks pass**:
